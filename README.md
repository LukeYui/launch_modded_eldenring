# Elden ring launcher

Launches Elden Ring without Easy Anti-Cheat. By default the game will not connect to FromSoftware's matchmaking servers, so online play is disabled.

Intended for convenience, and may be useful as launchers to inject dlls in order to run offline mods.

Please don't attempt to play online without Easy Anti-Cheat.
